        <p>I am a Computer Science student and professional, passionate about distributed systems, their scaling and performance. I apply my technical knowledge to design solutions, develop systems and perform research to solve real-world challenges in an efficient way.</p>

        <p>I enjoy working with these systems because of the great potential of distributed system to impact our lives. Better scaling and performance enable the new awesome applications that benefit our lives, reduce costs and allow us to achieve more with less resources, which are being already consumed in <a href="http://www.thegreengrid.org/%7E/media/Member%20Added/Understanding%20Data%20Center%20Energy%20Intensity08122010.pdf?lang=en">staggering amounts</a> to power our technological lifestyles.</p>

<a id="my-background" class="anchor" href="#my-background" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>My background</h3>

<p>My journey began in Guatemala, where I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. The environment in the small university and country was great for learning, not only about algorithms, compilers and databases, but also for exploring other interests like physics and literature.</p>

<p>The close involvement with the Physics department and the Astronomy club led me to explore the cloud, clusters, information systems and simulations while we tried to join the <a href="https://www.aps.org/units/fip/newsletters/201202/lago.cfm">LAGO project</a> in an environment with unique challenges. Later I also did a summer internship in the Mexican <a href="http://cio.mx/en/">CIO</a> research institute for optics.</p>

<p>In the final years of school I began working, developing software in the telecommunications sector. I worked on the end-to-end development of a product, learning valuable lessons along the way. </p>

<p>Currently I'm studying a master's degree in Pervasive Computing and Communications with the support of a scholarship from the European Commission. The program has a mobility scheme, taking place in Université de Lorraine (France), Lappeenranta University of Technology (Finland) and Luleå University of Technology (Sweden). Every place has provided education in their particular expertise, including networks, service-oriented architecture, green IT, sensor networks, cloud systems and research, and a wealth of experiences about our diverse, connected world.</p>

<p>During this time I also had the opportunity to <a href="http://victoraraujo.me/babeltrace-zipkin/">contribute</a> to open source projects like Ceph through Google Summer of Code, with hopefully many more contributions to come.</p>

<p>I'm always up for grabbing some filter coffee, travelling to new cities and hiking around <a href="http://www.crooked-compass.com/blog/volcano-experiences/">volcanoes</a> when I have the chance.</p>
